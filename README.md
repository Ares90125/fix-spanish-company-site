I 'm going to tell you how to develop this project.
This project has been consist of two parts: frontend and backend.
I 'm going to develop frontend with reactjs because react is the most framework to develop frontend and it has a lot of advantages.
The frontend has mainly 4 parts: landing page, sigin/singup page, user private page, service/payment page.
I 'll develop the project following your process map.
It is the most important that don't allow users to input the special characters in any input box.
There are no problem to develop frontend.
Next I 'm going to develop backend with nodejs because nodejs has a lot of advantages too such as fast on server.
It has mainly 4 parts: manage the signin/signup and save it in db, upload and download the files in private field and manage it according to the check result by manager and insert it in db, manage payments and send the data from database according to the requests from frontend.
I think it 's good to use mysql for database.
Particularly the passwords of users have to  been saved with hash value in database for security.
That 's all.
I hope you give me a lot of advices.
Thanks.

We don't allow users to input any input box except password because prevend the "insert sql attack'.
You said that There are user input logs that specifically ask "the user must enter at least XX characters (for example 10) and there must be at least one number, one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter and one special character.
It could be request for only password but other input boxs because password is not saved in database as input value.
It saved in database as hash value.

If userid is the admin-id, the site give him the idntity to access control page.
In this control page, admin can see all users' states and their uploaded/downloaded file list.
Also admin check the uploading file of user and send message to user.(pending/revised invalid/revised valid).
The other functions is defined by your company 's request.
If I am hired by you, we have to discuss about more details for your site including web design, admin's function and so on.

Hello. He spoke with our team. As I told you before, the Project-2022-01 landing page is an independent landing page from the general informative landing pages of the activities of the 5 target groups and as I told you, these 5 landing pages will be developed by us, so Therefore, you must focus your work on the unique and independent landing page of Project-2022-01. The designs that we are going to start making from tomorrow are independent designs of the landing page of Projec-2022-01. As I express, the landing page (unique) that you have to do must contain (1) the information that the user will have when they register (this is the process map for this) (2) must state the security of the information of the documentation that the user places in his private area. For the landing page (unique) that you have to do, before developing the landing page, propose the MOCKUPS (mockups are used in the initial design phase to visualize ideas and concepts in the context of web design and include the navigation structure, the site and design elements in detail.), as well as the MOCKUP of the administrator and user panel. The MOCKUPS, you can make them in the simplest, most agile and fastest way, do them as you like best in a schematic and simple way, (skews, diagrams...) it is not necessary to program them, it is a matter of seeing the diagrams, thanks, Javier (2022.05.16.09.32)(jcl validated correct)

(2022.05.17.22.37) In relation to the previous record that I placed in (2022.05.16.09.30): 

" ( copy ) For the landing page (unique) that you have to do, before developing the landing page, propose the MOCKUPS (mockups are used in the initial design phase to visualize ideas and concepts in the context of web design and include the navigation structure, the site and design elements in detail.), as well as the MOCKUP of the administrator and user panel.

The programmer informs in (2022.05.17.15.37) that she is already making the landing page, without having presented the design proposals that have been requested.
